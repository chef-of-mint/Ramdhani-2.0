# RAMDHANI 2.0

We have developed a prototype of web application for Ramdhani Enterprises , IIT (ISM) Dhanbad. As most of the food stalls have started an online ordering system , we thought of developing an online system for Ramdhani Shop as our DBMS Project.

## Tech Stack :

**Client:** HTML , CSS , Javascript

**Server:** PHP , phpMyAdmin , SQL


## Reflection :
This was a 4-week long project built during our 5th semester at IIT (ISM) Dhanbad. Project goals included using technologies learned from DBMS course and familiarizing ourselves with documentation for new features.

Originally we wanted to build a website for a local food shop to move it working from an offline to an online format, to make it more convenient for the customers as well as the owner.

Managing data in the backend was the most challenging task, especially sending data from PHP to Javascript on a different page. Due to project time constraints, we focused more on the functionality than the visuals of the website.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project is SQL, PHPMyAdmin, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In the next Iteration, we planned to add a payment gateway and a delivery page to add more functionality to it.
